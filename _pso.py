Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm Implementation

This module implements the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for solving continuous optimization problems.
PSO is inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling, where particles move 
in the search space based on their own experience and the experience of the swarm.

Key components to implement:
1. Particle representation (position, velocity)
2. Personal best memory
3. Global best memory
4. Velocity update rule
5. Position update rule

Usage:
    from _pso import ParticleSwarmOptimization
    
    # Define objective function to minimize
    def objective_function(x):
        return sum(x**2)  # Example: minimize sum of squares
        
    # Define bounds for each parameter
    bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]  # Example: 2D problem with bounds [-5, 5]
    
    # Create PSO instance
    config = PSOConfig(objective_function=objective_function, bounds=bounds)
    pso = ParticleSwarmOptimization(config)
    
    # Run optimization
    best_position, best_fitness = pso.optimize()
