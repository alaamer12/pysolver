Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm Implementation

This module implements the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for solving optimization problems.
ABC is inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees, consisting of employed bees, 
onlooker bees, and scout bees working together to find optimal food sources.

Key components to implement:
1. Food source representation (candidate solutions)
2. Employed bee phase for neighborhood search
3. Onlooker bee phase for exploitation
4. Scout bee phase for exploration
5. Fitness evaluation

Usage:
    from __abc import ArtificialBeeColony
    
    # Define objective function
    def objective_function(x):
        return sum(x**2)  # Example: minimize sum of squares
        
    # Define bounds for each parameter
    bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]  # Example: 2D problem with bounds [-5, 5]
    
    # Create ABC instance
    config = ABCConfig(objective_function=objective_function, bounds=bounds)
    abc = ArtificialBeeColony(config)
    
    # Run optimization
    best_solution, best_fitness = abc.optimize()
